            The 2024 BMW iX2 is an all-electric compact SUV, available in two main variants: the iX2 eDrive20 and the iX2 xDrive30. The eDrive20 features a single front-mounted motor producing 150 kW of power and 247 Nm of torque, while the xDrive30 boasts a dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup with 230 kW and 494 Nm, capable of accelerating from 0-100 km/h in just 5.6 seconds.

In terms of range, the iX2 eDrive20 offers up to 477 km on a full charge (WLTP), and the iX2 xDrive30 offers a range of up to 449 km. Both versions can be fast-charged using DC chargers at up to 130 kW, which takes the battery from 10% to 80% in under 30 minutes. The iX2 supports AC charging up to 22 kW as well.

The car's dimensions include a length of 4554 mm, width of 1845 mm, and height of 1560 mm, with a wheelbase of 2692 mm. It provides a boot capacity of 525 liters, which expands to 1400 liters with the rear seats folded down.
