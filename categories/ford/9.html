            The 2024 Ford Kuga offers a refined design, advanced technology, and multiple powertrain options. It features a more premium interior with a redesigned dashboard and upgraded infotainment system, including a standard 8-inch screen or an optional 12.3-inch screen with SYNC 4. The system supports smartphone connectivity, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and even Alexa Built-In for voice commands.

            Under the hood, the Kuga offers several powertrain choices:
            - A 1.5L EcoBoost petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
            - A 2.0L EcoBoost petrol engine with 190 horsepower.
            - A mild hybrid (mHEV) and a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version, the latter combining a 2.5L Duratec petrol engine with an electric motor to deliver 225 horsepower and up to 56 km of electric-only driving range.
            
            Key features include advanced driver-assistance technologies like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and a 360-degree camera system. The Kuga also provides excellent practicality, with sliding second-row seats to increase legroom or boost boot space.
            
            The Kuga comes in various trims like Titanium, ST-Line, and Active, catering to different driving needs, from city commuting to rugged off-road adventures. The expected pricing for the 2024 model will reflect its updated features, though final details are still pending.
