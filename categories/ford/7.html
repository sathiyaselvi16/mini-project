            The Suzuki Equator is a midsize pickup truck that was sold in the United States from 2009 to 2012. It was essentially a rebadged version of the Nissan Frontier, with only minor differences, such as a new front end and a rebadged steering wheel. The Equator offered two main engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 152 horsepower, and a 4.0-liter V6 engine with 261 horsepower, with both engine variants offering either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive options.

            The Equator was available in several configurations, including a Crew Cab with both short and long bed options, and an Extended Cab. Despite being based on a reliable Nissan design, the Suzuki Equator never gained significant traction in the U.S. market, mainly due to Suzuki's limited dealership network and brand presence. Production ended in 2012 when Suzuki pulled out of the U.S. auto market, making the Equator a rare vehicle today.
