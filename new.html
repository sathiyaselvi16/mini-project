      <p>BMW, short for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, is a renowned German luxury automobile and motorcycle manufacturer
        headquartered in Munich, Bavaria. Established in 1916, BMW initially focused on producing aircraft engines
        before transitioning to automobiles and motorcycles. The brand is globally recognized for its innovation,
        engineering excellence, and commitment to delivering premium performance vehicles. With iconic models like the
        BMW 3 Series, 7 Series, and its M performance lineup, the company has carved a niche for itself in the luxury

      <p>
        BMW is owned by the BMW Group (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG), which is a publicly traded company with shares
        listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Unlike some other automakers, BMW does not have a single individual
        owner; instead, it is primarily owned by shareholders, with the Quandt family being the largest stakeholders.
        The Quandt family has played a significant role in BMW's success over the decades.

        **Stefan Quandt**, born on May 9, 1966, and his sister **Susanne Klatten**, born on April 28, 1962, are the most
        prominent figures associated with BMW's ownership. They inherited their stakes in BMW from their father, Herbert
        Quandt, who is credited with saving the company from bankruptcy in the 1960s and steering it towards becoming a
        global luxury automotive leader. Stefan Quandt holds around 25% of the company, while Susanne Klatten owns
        approximately 20%. Together, they have a combined controlling interest in BMW, making them influential in its
        strategic decisions.

        Stefan Quandt is a German industrialist and engineer who also manages other investments through his holding
        company, AQTON. Susanne Klatten, Germany's richest woman and a trained economist, has diversified her portfolio
        with investments in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries through her company, SKion. Both siblings
        maintain a low public profile and are known for their discretion regarding personal life details. Despite their
        significant wealth, estimated in the billions, they have focused on maintaining BMW's reputation as a leader in
        innovation, quality, and sustainability within the automotive sector.

        BMW’s corporate structure ensures that the Quandts, despite their substantial stakes, work alongside other
        institutional and individual shareholders to guide the company's direction. The CEO and board of directors
        oversee day-to-day operations, ensuring the legacy of precision, performance, and luxury continues under the BMW
        brand.
